[Demo: Applying Basic CSS]
Now that you have linked your stylesheet, let's see how to apply some basic styles with a quick demo from your instructor before diving into your activity. 
These initial styles will help set a solid foundation for your web page's design.
Preparing a Project:
Watch along as your instructor starts by opening their code editor, creates a new local repository, and makes an index.html and `styles.css` file. 
Then, theyâ€™ll link them like we learned earlier and use AI to create some simple HTML content before applying the CSS steps below.
Styling the Body:
Setting the background color and font properties for the entire page ensures a consistent look and feel.
body { background-color: #f0f0f0; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #333; }
The background color helps to reduce eye strain, and the font family ensures that the text is easy to read.
Styling Headings:
To make headings stand out, you can define different font sizes and colors.
h1 { font-size: 2em; color: #4CAF50; }
h2 { font-size: 1.5em; color: #2196F3; }
This hierarchy in text styles helps users quickly understand the structure and importance of the content.
Styling Paragraphs:
Ensuring paragraphs have good readability involves setting an appropriate line height and spacing.
p { line-height: 1.6; margin-bottom: 1em; }
The margin-bottom property adds space between paragraphs, preventing them from appearing too cluttered.
